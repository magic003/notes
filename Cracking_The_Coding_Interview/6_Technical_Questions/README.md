Technical Questions
===================

## Technical Preparation

**How to Practice a Question**   
1. Try to solve the problem on your own.
2. Write the code for the algorithm on paper.
3. Test your code -- on paper.
4. Type your paper code as-is into a computer.

## Handling Technical Questions

**Five Steps to a Technical Question**   
1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.
2. Design an algorithm.
3. Write pseudocode first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you'll eventually write "real" code.
4. Write your code at a moderate pace.
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes.

## Five Algorithm Approaches

1. Examplify
2. Pattern Matching
3. Simplify and Generalize
4. Base Case and Build
5. Data Structure Brainstorm
