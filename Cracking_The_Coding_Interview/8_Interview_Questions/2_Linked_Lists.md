Linked Lists
============

Singly linked list and doubly linked list

Deleting a node from a singly linked list:   
1. check for the null pointer
2. update the head or tail pointer as necessary

The "Runner" technique is used in many linked list problems.

A number of linked list problems rely on recursion. It takes at least O(n) space, where n is the depth of the recursive call.
