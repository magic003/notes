Generating a list of Primes: The Sieve of Eratosthenes

Things to Watch Out For   
1. Be careful with the difference in precision between floats and doubles.
2. Don't assume that a value is an int unless you've been told so.
3. Unless otherwise specified, do not assume that events are independent (or mutually exclusive).
