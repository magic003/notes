Introduction to Algorithm Design
================================

**What is an algorithm?**   
An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task. An algorithm is a procedure that takes any of the possible input instances and transforms it to the desired output.

1.3 Reasoning about Correctness
-------------------------------

A proper mathematical proof consists of several parts:   
1. There is a clear, precise statement of what you are trying to prove.   
2. There is a set of assumptions of things which are taken to be true and hence used as part of the proof.   
3. There is a chain of reasoning which takes you from these assumptions to the statement you are trying to prove.   
4. There is a little square or QED at the bottom to denote that you have finished.   

### 1.3.1 Expressing Algorithms

The three most common forms of algorithmic notation are: **English**, **pseudocode** and **a real programming language**.

### 1.3.2 Problems and Properties

Problem specifications have two parts:
* the set of allowed input instances,
* the required properties of the algorithm's output.

### 1.3.4 Induction and Recursion

Mathemtical induction is usually the right to verify the correctness of a recursive or incremental insertion algorithm.
