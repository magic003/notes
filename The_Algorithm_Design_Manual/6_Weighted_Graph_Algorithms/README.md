6.1 Minimum Spanning Trees
--------------------------

A spanning tree of a graph G = (V, E) is a subset of edges from E forming a tree connecting all vertices of V.   

The minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.   

There can be more than one minimum spanning tree in a graph.
