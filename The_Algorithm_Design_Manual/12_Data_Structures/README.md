Data Structures
===============

12.1 Dictionaries
-----------------

Dictionary implementations: hash tables, skip lists and balanced/unbalanced binary search tree.

Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passed, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.

For data sets so large that they will not fit in main memory you best bet will be some flavor of a B-tree.

12.2 Priority Queues
--------------------

Binary tree heaps prove most appropriate when you need other dictionary operations, or if you have an unbounded key range and do not know the maximum priority queue size in advance.

12.3 Suffix Trees and Arrays
----------------------------

Suffix trees and arrays are phenomenally useful data structures for solving string problems elegantly and efficiently. Proper use of suffix trees often speeds up string processing algorithms from O(n<sup>2</sup>) to linear time.

A suffix tree is simply a trie of all the proper suffixes of S.
