Intractable Problems and Approximation Algorithms

9.1 Problems and Reductions
---------------------------

Reductions are operations that convert one problem into another.

### 9.1.1 The Key Idea

A translation of instances from one type of problem to instances of another such that the answers are preserved is reduction.

Reductions are a way to show that two problems are essentially identical. A fast algorithm (or the lack of one) for one of the problems implies a fast algorithm (or the lack of one) for the other.

### 9.1.2 Decision Problems

The simplest interesting class of problems have answers restricted to true and false. There are called **decision problems**.
