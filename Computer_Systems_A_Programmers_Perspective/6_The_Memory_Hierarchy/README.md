The Memory Hierarchy
====================

6.1 Storage Technologies
------------------------

### 6.1.1 Random-Access Memory

Random-access memory (RAM) comes in two varieties -- static and dynamic.

### 6.1.2 Disk Storage

### 6.1.3 Storage Technology Trends

6.2 Locality
------------

In a program with good __temporal locality__, a memory location that is referenced once is likely to be referenced again multiple times in the near future.

In a program with good __spatial locality__, if a memory location is referenced once, then the program is likely to reference a nearby memory location in the near future.
